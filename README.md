Web User Interface for microcontroller ESP8266

With my library, you can easily create a web-based user interface quickly. The library is built on the ESP8266 microcontroller and has a fairly simple syntax. The library has a simple nesting system: all widgets are stored in the Block class, which is separated from the background in the interface. All blocks are stored in Blocks class and can be separated using AddHeader() function that adds a header. Blocks class is created together with Page class. Page class constructor accepts a string with page name. Blocks attached to Page can store unlimited number of blocks for widgets separation by meaning.

The interface is optimized for PC and mobile devices
